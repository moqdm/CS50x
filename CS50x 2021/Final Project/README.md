# CS50 final project: Chabahar problems forum

It's a python web application, a forum to collect problems of my city from my citizens.
> Because of the project has not been ran public, database of problem is full of imaginative and unrealistic problems.

## ***Description***

We see so many problems in the city every day. Problems that officials may not realize due to their busy schedule.
This site has been created to be a reference to be informed about the urban problems and difficulties of Chabahar
county. If you are a newcomer or a tourist, check this out (My PSet8 Homepage)
[About Chabahar county](https://moqdm.github.io/cs50/Homepage/). Of course, this is not only for Chabahar and it
can be extended to all cities and countries.
